                    Sanjeev having a 5+ year long entrepreneurial journey backing him up. 
                    With all the expertise he had on scaling up startups and building 
                    strategies for the best brands in his previous company eventually 
                    stumbled upon Prateek who is a highly sought-after designer in the 
                    country, He is known for consistently coming up with innovative and 
                    original ideas, making him a valuable asset in the creative industry. 
                    Both being extremely ambitious and with all the like minded vision 
                    they both had they both joined hands and came up with Grustl considering 
                    the fact that there is no creative agency or resources in the country 
                    that doesn’t understand that “for a business to stand out of the box 
                    the traditional routes should be skipped out of the box ideas should be welcomed”. 
                    Both these pals identified a problem in the commercial space and came up with a fix.
